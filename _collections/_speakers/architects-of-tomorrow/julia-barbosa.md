Julia is a Warwick alumnus, graduating with an LLM in International Development
Law and Human Rights in 2009). Her talk is a thought-provoking discussion on
how people understand work, fulfilment and happiness. It looks at the shifting
paradigm of how we relate to work now, and what the future of work looks like.
It is inspired by her voyage around the world and the people she met along the
way - people from different walks of life who all had a special story to tell.
