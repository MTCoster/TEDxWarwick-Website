An award-winning architect, James is best known for his design projects which
intend to provide shelter to the homeless. His project 'Homes for the Homeless'
develops a modular homeless shelter that would hang off the sides of existing
buildings. James has worked to create a name for himself and his work within
the industry of architecture. In recent years, he has become a frequent guest
writer in *Grand Designs Magazine* and has made live appearances on the news,
addressing his efforts towards combating homelessness through architectural
design. Due to his success, in 2015 and more recent years, James was a member
of the judging panel for the International
