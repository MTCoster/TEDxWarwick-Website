## Speak at the TEDxWarwick Student Salon

Following the success of our first-ever Student Salon at the beginning of 2017
and our second edition in 2018, we are now looking for speakers and performers
for our upcoming Student Salon in January 2020.

You can apply to be a speaker, a performer or a hybrid (speaker with some
performance elements).

We're looking to hear from current students at the University of Warwick, from
both undergraduate and postgraduate backgrounds, who have an interesting story
or idea that deserves to be shared. We are particularly interested in
individuals who have taken an innovative approach to reinvent their
discipline or passion, or who portray a comprehensive knowledge of a chosen
topic. Performers are given more flexibility in this regard, with more emphasis
being placed on their skill.

Don't worry if you don't have it all pinned down yet - we'll be guiding you
through the content curation and speech delivery process. All you need is an
idea worth spreading!

If your written application impresses us, we will invite you to an audition
where you will get a chance to perform 5 minutes of your talk or performance.
Auditions will be held in Weeks 8-10 of Term 1.

So if you are...

An **INVENTOR** sharing an innovation with community-changing potential

A **TEACHER** sharing valuable knowledge in a memorable way to children,
teenagers or adults around the world

A **PRODIGY** with young talent ready to break out

An **ARTIST** who can showcase their work in a compelling, new way

A **PERFORMER** of music, dance, comedy, drama, or something entirely
different

A **SAGE** with wisdom the world needs from those who have learned it the hard
way

An **ENTHUSIAST** with an infectious passion for a topic they can share

A **CHANGE AGENT** helping shape the world's future with work that matters

A **STORYTELLER** - vivid, original, meaningful - with a talent for connection

A **SPARK** with a powerful idea worth spreading

...you should apply to take part in our Student Salon!
