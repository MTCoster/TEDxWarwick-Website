sections:
  - name: content
    label: Content
    description: |
      The Content team's key task is the selection and preparation of all
      speakers. This role would be suitable for you if you are an excellent
      researcher and are confident and committed to the ethos of TED. Other
      responsibilities include speaker preparation and speaker hospitality,
      working closely with all speakers to make sure all arrangements are met
      and content is rehearsed to ensure speakers give the best talk of their
      life.

      The team is responsible for suggesting and contacting potential speakers
      for the main TEDxWarwick conference and for the two TEDxWarwick salon
      events. The team is therefore looking for candidates with the following
      qualities:

      - Excellent intuition and research skills
      - Excellent communication skills
      - Ability to remain committed and focused in the face of regular
        disappointment
      - Due to the high profile nature of the speakers we contact, a high level
        of professionalism and competency with the English language is required
        for this position

      **In your application, please tell us about someone you would like to see
      as a speaker and explain both why you chose them, and why they would be a
      good fit.**

  - name: corporate-relations
    label: Corporate Relations
    description: |
      The Corporate Relations team focuses on creating and maintaining strong
      partnership relations with sponsors and with the press. This is an
      ongoing process throughout the year and requires applicants who are
      committed to working intimately with our sponsors and press contacts. The
      team is therefore looking for applicants who:

      - Are professional, persuasive and confident in their interactions with
        the companies that we deal with
      - Have strong written and verbal communication skills and flawless
        attention to detail when it comes to writing to external contacts
      - Have a holistic understanding and interest in what drives TEDxWarwick
        and what makes it valuable to sponsors and the press

      The Corporate Relations team is an excellent opportunity to explore
      negotiation, salesman and partnership skills. Much of the learning with
      TEDx comes on the job and so enthusiasm comes before experience.

  - name: creative
    label: Creative
    description: |
      The Creative team focuses on creating all graphical and visual elements
      for upcoming TEDxWarwick events. There are various aspects covered within
      the Creative team, which include, but are not limited to digital
      photography, shooting and editing video footage, creating posters and
      flyers for marketing, stage and magazine design, and TEDxWarwick
      merchandise creation to a professional standard.

      On the one hand, we are looking for team members who:

      - Have experience in at least one of the following programs: Photoshop,
        Illustrator or InDesign
      - Are willing to dedicate a fair portion of their time throughout the
        year towards creating visual elements for the TEDxWarwick brand

      On the other hand, we are looking for team members who:

      - Have experience in digital photography, and/or video recording &
        editing
      - Are able to edit videos and photos within tight timeframes using Final
        Cut or Premiere Pro

      In both cases, we are looking for team members with an eye for detail,
      and the ability to curate visual elements as means to promote our events.
      If either (or both) of these descriptions are a match for your skill
      sets, we want to hear from you.

  - name: marketing
    label: Marketing
    description: |
      The Marketing team works towards moulding the public perception and the
      branding of TEDxWarwick, in and around the Warwick community, through the
      promotion of our event as well as the TED ethos. The framework and focus
      of our outreach effort binds us closely with the rest of the team, in
      particular Creative and Technical. The Marketing team are looking for
      members who:

      - Preferably have previous experience in marketing.
      - Can creatively and effectively communicate core ideas (both verbally
        and in writing)
      - Understand the audience they are trying to reach
      - And ideally (but not necessarily) have some experience working with
        social media and blogging

      Most importantly, however, the Marketing team values a genuine drive to
      overcome uncertainties and instinctive passion for learning, as well as
      organisation skills and an ability to work under pressure.

  - name: operations
    label: Operations
    description: |
      The Operations team is responsible for the flawless execution of
      TEDxWarwick 2020. This includes -- and is not limited to -- organising
      the venue, catering, ticketing and volunteer management. You will be
      working closely with the other TEDxWarwick teams to ensure that all
      logistics and operations are in order. An Operations team member must be
      able to communicate effectively with service providers, have a great
      attention to detail and be able to deal with unexpected problems. Due to
      the nature of the work, team members must be able to dedicate large
      amounts of time in the weeks leading up to the event. We are looking for
      team members who:

      - Have strong organisational skills, preferably with previous experience
        in organising events
      - Have excellent attention to detail
      - Have strong communication skills
      - Are flexible, passionate, conscientious, and are willing to take the
        initiative


  - name: publications
    label: Publications
    description: |
      We successfully introduced the TEDxWarwick Magazine in 2014 and have
      issued it every year since. Therefore, we are looking for a few team
      members to join our publications team, which is responsible for editing
      and curating the content of the TEDxWarwick 2020 magazine and blog. They
      include information and articles about the main event, history of the
      society, salon events, past and future speakers -- basically anything
      that might be relevant to TEDxWarwick. We are looking for someone who:

      - Has a strong understanding of the TED ethos and a vision for
        TEDxWarwick Magazine
      - Has strong writing skills and passion for blogging
      - Has excellent time management skills and is able to work under pressure
      - Has good communication skills for liaising with the Technical,
        Creative, Marketing and other teams in order to achieve great results
      - Preferably (although not necessarily) has some previous experience in
        blogging, writing articles for a magazine or a newspaper

      **In your application, please include a blog entry (max 300 words) on any
      topic you are passionate about.  We want to hear your personal voice, but
      be mindful to present your opinions objectively!**

  - name: technical
    label: Technical
    description: |
      The Technical team is responsible for the design and maintenance of our
      website, as well as various technical aspects of the live events. We work
      closely with the Creative and Marketing teams, and in particular liaise
      with departments of the University and the Warwick Arts Centre in the
      run-up to our main event. Our main aim for 2020 is to improve the quality
      and consistency of our live recordings.

      The following skills are preferable but not essential; anyone with an
      interest in technology and the desire to learn will be considered.

      - Some web development experience. We love modern web features from
        HTML5, CSS3 and ES6, but don't worry if you just know the classics. For
        the curious, our website is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub
        Pages. It's also open source.
      - A basic understanding of the technical aspects of live events,
        including live sound; event photo/videography, and vision mixing.

      In addition, the technical team is also looking for camera operators for
      all of our events who are either experienced, or otherwise confident in
      their abilities.
